### Oh hello, Mr. Black here. Aside from my many cinematic successes such as Kung Fu Panda 2 and Jumanji: The Next Level, I am avid gambler. So much so that they named my game of choice after me. It used to be called "21 or bust", but has since been renamed **BlackJack**, an honor I will forever cherish. Anywho, with my hectic schedule, I seldom have time to play in person. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make me the greatest digital game of blackjack anyone has ever experienced. I specifically want it to be built with Python 3, and I only want it to be excecuted via the command line as I despise Gooeys. It's almost impossible you don't know what blackjack is, or the rules, but if ysomehow you don't know, here is a [link](https://www.888casino.com/blog/blackjack-strategy-guide/how-to-play-blackjack) to rules and everything else you need to know.

### If that was too long and you refused to read, here are my requirements, in game order. Feel free to use this list to keep track of what you have done:

- [ ] We need to have a card
- [ ] We need to have a deck, which contains 52 cards
- [ ] The deck needs to be shuffled 
- [ ] Cards need to be dealt from the deck
- [ ] The players need to be able to have a hand of dealt cards
- [ ] The players need to have some moola
- [ ] The player needs to be able to bet moola 
- [ ] We need to keep track of moola wins and losses
- [ ] We need to implement all of the logic of "21 or Bust" aka blackjack
